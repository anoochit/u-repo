APTURL is protocal handler let you install package via URL like apt:packagename. It parse the url and send value of packagename to command line. So Ubuntu has firefox extention call "ubufox" with this package you can use APTURL to install package like using in nautilus or apt command line. I was write the script fro generate/update repository (refer debian repository standard). The URepo script compose of dists directory store the content and package database and pool directoy to store deb packages. The advantage of this method is user and use the repository by add the following repo data to /etc/apt/sources.list. This project is the part of [Idea Connect!](http://innovative.ideaconnect.co.cc).
